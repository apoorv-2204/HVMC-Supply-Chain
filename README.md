# [dev-repo]HVMC-Supply-Chain-[Final-year]-[Research-Project]-[Unorganized]

HVMC is an abbreviation for "High Value Medical Cargo." A term coined from the intensive research carried out during COVID regarding the mass distribution of vaccines across India. Its supply chain was the main focus, revolving around the actors. The report is based upon the interviews of various doctors and corresponding actors, and reports and training-modules made available by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India. I am proud to have been born in Bharat.
